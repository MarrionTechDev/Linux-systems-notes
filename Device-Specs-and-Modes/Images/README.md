## Images

This is the machine I had lying around and decided to use as a Linux machine.

The folder contains images of the Dell D630 before, during, and after installing Debian 12.0.0 Linux Distro.

## Issues
- Had to reset the bios password on boot. (used https://bios-pw.org/ )
- Reset the System Password in BIOS and set it to blank. (used the same password)
