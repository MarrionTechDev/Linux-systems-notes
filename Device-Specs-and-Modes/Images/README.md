## Images

This is the machine I had lying around and decided to use as a Linux machine.

The folder contains images of the Dell D630 before, during, and after installing Debian 12.0.0 Linux Distro.

## Issues
- Had to reset the BIOS (System) password on boot. (used https://bios-pw.org/ )
- Reset the System Password in BIOS and set it to blank. (used the same password)
  Made sure:
  System Password = Disabled
  Setup Password = Disabled
- The laptop had a Windows XP login password. (Ignored it since I would wipe it with Linux)
- Battery wasn't charging. "The system cannot communicate with this battery." (Ignored it since I would use it as a server later with a charger.)
- Upgraded both the HDD to an SSD. Original screws were too short (Ignored it since it still registered in BIOS and clicked in place after pushing it further)
